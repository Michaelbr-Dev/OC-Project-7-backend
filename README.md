### Back end Installation

1. Clone this repo.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. You can then run the server with `node server`.

The server should run on localhost with default port 3000. If the server runs on another port for any reason, this is printed to the console when the server starts, e.g. Listening on port 3001.
